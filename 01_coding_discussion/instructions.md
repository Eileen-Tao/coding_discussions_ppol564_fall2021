# Coding Discussion 01

## Instructions 

For this discussion, please do the following: 

- Clone the class Github repository `coding_discussions_ppol564_fall2021`.
- In the repostory, you'll find the "01_coding_discussion/" containing a `.txt` file entitled `first_collaboration.txt`. In the file, write your full name plus (a) a sentence/paragraph regarding why you chose to come to public policy school and what aspect of public policy interests you most, (b) a sentence regarding one thing new you learned in class this week that you did not previously know. Each of these points should occupy a new line.

	```
	John Doe
	a. I decided to come to a public policy school because...
	b. I learned...
	```


## Things to keep in mind

- You'll need to be added to the class github repository to push changes. Please make sure you've registered your Github userid to the [following Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Flrf1O15queLQArdliyhK8z1YgGEjfAIRWsMLFUEfKk/edit?usp=sharing) so we can add you as a contributor. 
- Note that the tricky part of the first task will be having so many of you working in the same file. Be sure not to overwrite each others work. **_Make sure all merge conflicts are dealt with_**. Though the input may seem trivial, collaborating through a single file on Github will not be. There is a high probability that you'll run into issues, try and resolve them using both the reading, lecture material, and the internet. 

## Aim

In this coding discussion, we will have done four things: (1) added you as a contributor to the class git repo, (2) interacted and mutually collaborated on a mock project file, (3) downloaded a repository, edited it locally, and then pushed it back to the remote, and (4) dealt with some basic version conflict errors.
